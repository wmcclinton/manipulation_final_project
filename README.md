## Running the MeshPainter Notebook
### Prerequisite:
Unfortunately, we have not found a way to get this code to work with DeepNote (please do try though using the docker container `russtedrake/manipulation:mesh_painter`). Thus, in order to run it, you will have to first clone [this PR of Drake](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/pull/16147), and then [install PyDrake from source](https://drake.mit.edu/python_bindings.html). 

Install moviepy with `pip install moviepy`

### Usage
You should be able to just run all cells in the notebook. Take care to read the comments: you will probably have to change particular paths and uncomment various lines.
